\## Question: What is the difference between a git "merge" and a GitHub "pull request"?

\### Git Merge

Git merge is a \*\*local Git command\*\* that combines the code changes from one branch directly into another branch on your local machine. It is a core Git function, does not require GitHub or an internet connection, and immediately integrates commit histories without any review process. It only works within your own local repository.



\### GitHub Pull Request (PR)

A pull request is a \*\*web-based collaboration feature on GitHub\*\*, not a native Git command. It is used to propose your changes to the owner of the original (upstream) repository, allowing for code review, comments, automated checks, and approval before any merging happens. PRs connect your forked repository to the original repo and are used for team collaboration on remote repositories.



\### Key Difference Summary

\- git merge: Local Git operation, direct branch combination, no review, no GitHub required.

\- Pull Request: GitHub web feature, request to merge, includes review/approval, for collaborative remote repositories.
